# Jameson - Connecting Their Brand With Their Consumers.

Working for An Púcán has opened so many doors for myself and others over the past two years its been an amazing opportunity and adventure. 

One of the most beneficial things has been working with major international companies over the last two years, from Guinness running their Amplified Campaign in Galway with Kodaline and London Grammar, to launching our Beer Garden with Absolute and having so many social interactive props involved its been such a massive learning curve. 

But on Monday just gone the 29th of February we were lucky enough to be chosen as the venue of choice for Jameson Barrelman Sessions. 

So what is the Jameson Barrelman Sessions?

Its their way of further developing the relationship between bartenders and whiskey enthusiasts alike and the ever growing brand that is Jameson. Jameson already have an amazing consumer base who are amazingly supportive of their brand and extremely loyal to the brand but they don't stop with just that, they go above and beyond this which is something I really like to see with major brands, who although are international and bigger than most brands could ever imagine becoming they still like to try and keep that local business, small brand perception, they really work hard to give their brand a face and this is evident with the amazing Jameson ambassadors working all over the world, I have cousins, friends, family all working for this brand all over the world and its an amazing company to watch,  they like to reward the support they receive at every opportunity.

The Jameson Barrelman Sessions itself was a night where the bartenders of Galway were firstly educated on two of their whiskeys, Jameson Black Barrel and Jameson Caskmates. They were then taken through some training of the Jameson, Ginger & Lime perfect serve in a way which brought some great craic and competitiveness to the night. The night itself had a number of different aspects to it including both the whiskey tasting and the JGL speed races which was won by our very own Eoin Corcoran (E2theC) who managed to beat the various other bartenders around Galway by pouring the perfect Jameson Ginger & Lime the fastest, they also incorporated some Jameson games including a black barrel table tennis table which looked so impressive, foosball table and darts! They had amazing Jameson decor and the whole venue was turned green to resemble the inside of a Jameson bottle.  
The night culminated with a brilliant performance from the very talented 'Amazing Apples' and was truly a memorable experience.

We are very lucky in Galway to work alongside such great ambassadors for Jameson such as Gary Feeney who helped execute the night and made it the major success that it was and also to have such great on the ground Irish Distillers Business Development representation with John Molloy who has been phenomenal to work with over the past 18 months.   
It goes without saying that we work very hard in ensuring these nights are a success from our end as well, Philip Duignan works extremely hard to ensure everything is in running order, all the managers, bar staff and floor staff are extremely professional here in An Púcán, Tom Joyce the head chef ensured the food was of the highest standard(as per usual) for Jameson.For me seeing big name brands such as Jameson staying true to their roots is really eye opening, An Púcán is a venue that wants to create a mass audience around Ireland but still always be the local pub the Galwegians drink in and in order to do this we need to stay true to our roots at the same time. Developing your brand amongst your locals first and foremost, listening to what they want and don't want on a continuous basis, engaging with them daily on social media, creating unique and different content, supporting local businesses and charities when and where we can and helping the Arts and various other festivals that happen in Galway gain exposure.

Seeing Jameson do all this on Monday night really emphasised to me how important it is for your brand or product to stay close to its local and loyal consumers as they are and always will be your driving force to a successful venture.
